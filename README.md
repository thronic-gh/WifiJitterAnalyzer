## WiFi Jitter Analyzer

This software analyzes your connection for packet latency and connection stability.  

![Example UI](example_ui.jpg)  

Mainly created to test gaming setups for a stable flow of packets when logged into a massive 
online world where things happen in real-time and there's no time for buffering. A steady 
stream of packets is ultra important for all realtime online experiences and is without a 
doubt best covered by a physical connection, but this isn't always available, so it can be 
very useful to test your wireless quality. Packet loss is less important for recorded 
streaming services like YT, Netflix, etc. that can be buffered. But you want a good 
score for video chatting, online gaming, etc.
